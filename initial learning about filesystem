This document is information about the filesystem, and is my first serious learning about windows

Files System: NTFS

$Boot - takes part in the booting process
$MFT (master file table) - has an entry for each file in the filesystem
$Bitmap - keeps track of clusters
$LogFile - makes recovery possible
and others


========================== My Layout
C: - this is a mounted drive containing the operating system

PerfLogs - Supposedly empty
Program Files - actual program files
Program Files (x86)
Users
Windows



======================
 - so I can see that there are two directories in my Host C drive that is absent in the virtualbox C drive. 
   - both of them are due to the hardware, probably.
What I will do as a learning opportunity is go through and compare a fresh virtualbox install to my current install

====================It is different
